# NBA Shot Tracker

## Overview
This project was inspired by my love for the sport of basketball. Using Python and the plotting library Matplotlib, I implemented a shot tracker that plots made and missed shots from a specific player and season of choice. 

For example, here is the plotted result from Jeremy Lin's 2011-12 "Linsanity" season that broke the internet:

## How to run

To try the program for yourself:

1- Clone this repository: https://github.com/qinghanz/NBA-Shot-Tracker <br />
2- Using the IDE of your choice, create a virtual environment and activate it by running python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment <br />
3- run "pip3 install matplotlib" to install plotting library <br />
4- run "pip3 install nba_api" to install nba package <br />
5- run "main.py" with your selected player/season and enjoy! <br />

Special thanks to https://github.com/swar for great documentation of the NBA API.
